# TASK #Prompt2Code2

In the era of artificial intelligence, the software development process is undergoing a fundamental transformation. The traditional approach of writing code line by line is giving way to a new methodology, where developers act as prompt engineers and code is generated through carefully designed instructions for large language models.

The task is to create a demo of the system, with maximum support for AI models throughout the development process. In addition to delivering a working application, teams must document the process of working with code-generation models. The goal is to demonstrate how appropriate prompt design and iteration led to the final result.

UKNF requires an application for secure and efficient communication with supervised entities to support the exchange of information related to supervisory duties.

The system demo should consist of three main modules: Authentication and Authorization Module, Communication Module and System Administration Module.

We care about the **preferred functionalities**. But there are also innovations, improvements, **additional functionalities** – which will be an additional point in the assessment.

## Preferred functionalities

The Communication Module, which is to enable:

- **handling the acceptance of reports** submitted by supervised entities with feedback,
- **handling messages** with the possibility of attaching attachments ensuring two-way communication between internal and external users,
- **maintaining a local file repository** that performs the library function,
- **handling and handling cases** concerning supervised entities,
- **handling messages in the form of** a bulletin board, with the option to all or to selected groups of entities, with confirmation of reading by users of entities,
- **service of addressees, contact groups and contacts,**
- **maintaining a database of questions and answers** giving the opportunity to ask questions and view answers in the FAQ convention,
- **handling the file of entities and updating information on** supervised entities.

## Additional functionalities

The Authentication and Authorization module is to enable:

- **registration of external users** via an online form,
- **handling access requests** with assigning permissions to external users,
- **selection of the entity represented in the session** by an authenticated external user.

The Administrative Module shall enable:

- **management of internal and external user accounts** by UKNF employees with the role of system administrator,
- **management of password policy in the** system,
- **managing the roles of internal and external users.**

## In terms of application, we expect:

- preparing a demo of the system in a container environment with the delivery of the docker-compose.yml/compose.yml file,
- implementation of the portal in accordance with modern programming standards as a SPA (Single Page Application) type application with backend architecture based on REST API,
- Use of OpenSource software.

## In terms of documentation, we expect:

preparing specifications for a standardised software development process using language AI models ensuring:

- documenting the used prompts in the prompts.md or prompts.pdf file provided with the repository (chronologically),
- an indication of which prompts were most effective and why,
- If part of the code was created manually and part generated by AI, describe what the division of labor looked like and where the prompts were most helpful.

## We prefer

- implementation of the system frontend in Angular
- implementation of the system backend in OpenJDK or .NET
- use of relational database (MSSQL preferred)

## You have at your disposal:

A. specification of functional requirements
B. specification of non-functional requirements
C. specification of the expected technological stack
D. an exemplary specification of a standardised software development process using language models. Take it as a starting point – a suggestion, not a rigid rule. We encourage you to experiment and propose your own practices and improvements that will work best in your team
E. prototypes of selected low-detail screens, showing the main components of the UI of the application, and prototypes of selected forms that can be helpful in building the UI for the forms covered by the task
F. test data of supervised entities, to be imported
G. test report files with incorrect and correct data

## A. Specification of functional requirements

## Functions of the Communication Module

The module is designed to enable:

➢ handling the acquisition of reports submitted by supervised entities with feedback from validation of the status of reports,
➢ handling messages with the possibility of attaching attachments ensuring two-way communication between internal and external users,
➢ maintaining a local file repository that performs the library function,
➢ handling and handling cases concerning supervised entities,
➢ handling messages in the form of a bulletin board, with the option to all or to selected groups of entities, with confirmation of reading by representatives of entities,
➢ service of addressees, contact groups and contacts,
➢ maintaining a database of questions and answers giving the opportunity to ask questions and view answers in the FAQ convention,
➢ handling the file of entities and updating information on supervised entities.

### Description of the function

Report acquisition services are provided by:

- handling the acquisition of reports submitted to the UKNF by Supervised Entities with feedback from validation of the status of reports, in particular:
- uploading a file containing the report by the entity using the file attachment option. An employee of the Entity submits reports to the Supervised Entity in the form of MS Excel files in XLSX format. The templates of reporting files to be filled in each time downloads from the local repository of files - Libraries. Once submitted, the reports are automatically verified and subject to validation for compliance with the rules defined by the UKNF. The report's will be updated automatically. At the end of the validation, a report with the result of the analysis of the report and the current status will be attached to the submitted report. The report shall be validated by an external tool that will provide the result of the validation. The validation result file will contain the UKNF markings, the date of receipt of the report, the date of validation and the name of the entity. In addition, in the case of negative (technical errors, validation errors, etc.), the result file will contain the relevant information about the processing error. Attached are two regular reports with correct (G. RIP100000_Q1_2025.xlsx) and incorrect (G. RIP100000_Q2_2025.xlsx) data,
- display status, errors and technical and substantive validation report.

### Examples of validation statuses:

| Importance | Validation status |
|---|---|
| Working | transitional, set after adding a report file |
| Transmitted | transitional, set after the start of the validation process of the report. Confirmed with a unique ID. |
| Ongoing | transitional, set at the moment when the processing of the report is ongoing |
| Successful validation process | the processing of the report was successful and no validation errors were found as a result of the validation of the report. The report has been recorded and the data from the report will be analysed. |
| Errors from validation rules | the processing of the report has been completed, but errors in the validation rules have been detected as a result of the validation of the report |
| Technical error in the validation process | the processing of the report resulted in a validation process error |
| Error - Exceeded time | automatically set when the report processing process is not completed within 24 hours of adding the report file |
| Contested by UKNF | set only on demand in a situation where the UKNF Employee uses the action "Challenge" with the addition of the content of the field "Description of irregularities" |

- the possibility of reviewing the results of validation of reporting files submitted to the UKNF and monitoring changes in the status of reports submitted,
- the possibility for an employee of the UKNF to categorise the reports (organising in the so-called Report Registers) on the basis of metadata provided in files as registers, e.g. 'Quarterly reports', 'Annual reports' including 'current' and 'archival' – the possibility for a UKNF employee to transfer (mark) the report to the archive through the action 'Archiving the report',
- possibility to handle corrections of reports. An external user may submit a correction to the submitted report. The correction should be linked in the system to the adjusted report,
- the possibility of displaying, by an employee of the UKNF, in the form of summaries of the so-called Report logs with basic information about the report, including data of the user who added the report, i.e. Name, Surname, E-mail, Telephone, whether a correction has been made and filtering of these registers based on the quick filters "My entities" (reports of entities assigned to "My entities" at the UKNF Employee) and the filter of the validation status of the reporting period, etc.,
- the possibility for an employee of the UKNF to view information about the report in the details view, including the file, name, number, person submitting, entity submitting, reporting period, validation status, complex corrections, etc. metadata,
- maintaining the so-called reporting calendar (timetable), which, among others: informs entities about upcoming dates of sending reports, handles reminders, reports the progress and completeness of data flows within a specific reporting action,
- use of the Message Handling function in reporting - support for two-way communication between internal users (UKNF Employees) and external users (Administrators of the Supervised Entity and Employees of the Supervised Entity,
- the possibility for an employee of the UKNF to display in the form of a list of Entities that did not submit the selected report (there is no report submitted in the system with the status 'Validation process successfully completed' for the selected period) and to generate a new message.

### Message handling provides:

- two-way communication between internal users (UKNF Employees) and external users (Administrators of the Supervised Entity and Employees of the Supervised Entity), in particular:
- support for messages with the possibility of attaching attachments in allowed formats, i.e. PDF, DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, CSV/TXT, MP3 and zip packed files provided that the total size of the pre-packaged files does not exceed 100 MB,
- rejection of files with unexpected formats or exceeding the file size,
- rejecting messages from infected and containing SPAM,
- use of communication in system components - in access requests (conversation within the framework of external users' requests), cases, acquisition of reports,
- the ability to mark message statuses. Message statuses:

| Status | Importance |
|---|---|
| Awaits UKNF's response | Message Added by an External User |
| Awaiting the User's Response | message added by an employee of the UKNF |
| Closed | message for which there is a response from the UKNF Employee/External User |

- the possibility of displaying in the form of a list of messages addressed to entities by UKNF Employees and filtering the list based on quick filters: 'My entities' (requests of entities assigned to 'My entities' by a UKNF Employee), 'Requires UKNF responses' (messages with the status 'Pending UKNF response') and the filter of the component in which the message was used,
- Ensuring that supervised entities and external users can be grouped together (categorisation of recipients) in order to inform them simultaneously. Transmission of mass messages by the UKNF to designated Supervised Entities (selected from the list or by market types or by indicating groups).

### Maintaining the local file repository ensures:

- maintaining a repository of files in the form of a Library for the purpose of making them available to system users (e.g. report templates in Excel file format, instructions, descriptions, etc.), the repository of files is a common resource of all external Users. External users decide which files are accessed by the UKNF Employee. The repository shall ensure in particular:
- adding a file and modifying information about the file (metadata) by UKNF Employees – e.g. fields 'Filename', 'Reporting period', 'Model update date' and 'Annex' (template file). The UKNF employee has access to all files in the repository and can add, modify and delete files and their metadata,
- sharing files with all or individual users and selected groups of users,
- possibility of categorizing, filtering and sorting files,
- the ability to view the history of the file and view the history of changes,
- marking files available in the current and archival versions with the date of the last update.

### Handling and handling cases in administrative mode provides:

- handling and conducting administrative cases concerning supervised entities, in particular:
- creating cases (registration), assigning and monitoring progress on individual cases (case statuses). Cases are conducted between the Employees of the Supervised Entity and the Employees of the UKNF in the context of only one selected Supervised Entity and concerning one of the categories, e.g.: 'Change of registration data', 'Change of staff composition', 'Call to the Supervised Entity', 'Entitlements to the System', 'Reporting', 'Other' with prioritisation: 'Low', 'Medium' or 'High'.

### Examples of case statuses:

| Status of the case | Importance |
|---|---|
| Draft | set after saving the draft case. Such matters are not visible to the UKNF Employee |
| New case | set when the case is started/transferred. Such matters are visible to the UKNF Employee |
| Ongoing | set automatically after the case is opened by an Employee of the Supervised Entity or an Employee of the UKNF |
| To be completed | set by the Employee of the UKNF, indicates the need for the Employee of the Supervised Entity to supplement the information or annex on the |
| Cancelled | set by the UKNF Employee, possible to set if the Employee of the Supervised Entity has not yet become acquainted with it |
| Completed | status of the case set by the UKNF Employee, means the end of the case |

- storing and managing electronic documents related to individual cases – adding attachments to the case,
- cancellation of a case that has not yet been taken by the Employee of the Supervised Entity. A mechanism that allows, in the event of the creation of a message about the assignment of a new case that has been sent to an Employee of the Supervised Entity, to cancel that message (case) unless the employee has already become acquainted with it (i.e. has the status: The New Case). The content of the message will no longer be available to the Employee of the Supervised Entity and will instead see the message "cancelled message". In addition, a notification will be sent to the entity about the cancellation of the message. By the UKNF, such a case will be visible with Cancelled status. In such a case, the editing possibilities will be blocked,
- handling of messages - two-way communication between internal users (UKNF Employees) and external users (Administrators of the Supervised Entity and Employees of the Supervised Entity. Transmission of electronic messages as part of the case or in connection with the report, with annexes, by Supervised Entities to the UKNF and by the UKNF to Supervised Entities,
- the ability to view the Cases list with basic information about the cases, including the data of the user who added the case, i.e. Name, Surname, E-mail, Telephone,
- the possibility of reviewing information about the case in the view of details, including the name, number, entity concerned, case handler, category, messages transmitted as part of the case, etc. metadata,
- a preview of the history of changes in the case by the UKNF Employee and an external user.

### Handling messages in the form of a bulletin board ensures:

- handling messages made available by employees of the UKNF in the form of a bulletin board with the possibility of "read-only" with the registration of reading by representatives of entities, in particular:
- adding and publishing advertisements by authorized internal users,
- editing the content of the message using the WYSWIG editor,
- editing, removing from publications and removing existing redundant notices,
- attaching files (attachments) to messages,
- viewing a message with a history of changes,
- setting the expiry date of announcements,
- setting the priority for the message, i.e. 'Low', 'Medium', 'High',
- assigning notices to different categories (e.g. general information, events),
- defining groups of recipients, i.e. to individual external users, groups of external users or all external users,
- displaying announcements on the start page in the application to specific groups of recipients,
- an indication, e.g. a distinction on the part of the entity when it receives a new message,
- the ability to display a list of messages with filtering options,
- monitoring the activity of users in the field of message reading (statistics of message reading by entities, e.g. 71/100 entities) and popularity of announcements,
- the ability to set the maturity of the confirmation of a message read by an external User depending on the defined priority of the message. For 'High' priority messages, the user must click that they have read it. The confirmation will show the date and time of reading, the name of the user and the name of the entity he represented.

### Support for addressees, contact groups and contacts provides:

- Add and modify recipients, contact groups, and contacts. Recipients should be understood as external Users who are notified about events in the system (e.g. about adding a new Message) or receive permissions to selected files in the Library. There are four types of adding Addressees:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Selected entities | the addressee is any external User who is associated with any of the selected Entities from the list |
| Selected contact groups | so-called contact database - the addressee is each external User assigned to the selected Contact Group. |
| Selected types of entities | the addressee is any external User whose Entity is associated with the type of entity, e.g. 'Loan institution'. |
| Selected users | the addressee is any external user selected from the list of users |

The Contact Group is a list of selected Representatives of external entities and Users who may receive e-mail notifications from UKNF Employees. A person who is a member of such a Contact Group does not need to have access to the System, i.e. it does not need to be an external User. Adding such a person is possible by adding a new so-called. It's a contact. Contacts may include recipients who do not have to be users of the System. Employees of the UKNF may notify such persons by e-mail-about various events, e.g. assigning them to a selected Contact Group.

### Maintaining the Q&A database ensures:

- Possibility to ask and receive answers to questions and view anonymized questions with answers (so-called. Knowledge base FAQ), in particular:
- Adding new questions anonymously. Questions should have fields: title, content, category, labels, date added, status.
- adding answers to questions by the UKNF Employee,
- management of questions and answers - the possibility of modifying or removing questions/answers, changing the content, status and other fields by the UKNF Employee or the System Administrator,
- categorisation of questions and answers – grouping into categories,
- support for labels (tags) for better filtering,
- assessment of responses (e.g. asterisks 1-5),
- search by keyword, title, content, category or label.
- sorting the results by: popularity, date added, ratings.
- filtering by category, tags, response status.

### Handling the file of entities and updating information on supervised entities ensures:

- the possibility of maintaining information on supervised entities in the form of an Entity File in the system, in particular:
- adding and modifying data on the entity supervised by the System Administrator and the UKNF Employee, in accordance with the structure of:

| Name | fields type | Description |
|---|---|---|

- reviewing the history of changes in data about the entity,
- a preview of detailed data of the entity supervised by the System Administrator and the UKNF Employee,
- preview of the list of all Users of the Entity assigned in the system to a given Entity Supervised by the Entity Administrator, the System Administrator and the UKNF Employee,
- a preview of the details of the entity by external Users assigned to the entity in order to be able to verify the compliance of the data with the facts and report a change in the registration data (name of the entity, address data, telephone, e-mail) in the event of non-compliance or change in their change, through a case with the category "Change of registration data" (the report generates a new case).

### Updating information on supervised entities (entity data updater service) provides:

- the possibility of updating data on supervised entities (registration data) cooperating with the UKNF contained in the Entities Database, in order to store reliable information about entities and their relationships and history of changes, in particular:
- updating the data on the entity supervised by an authenticated Administrator of the Supervised Entity using the change form made available in the system (Name of the entity, Address: street, postcode and city Telephone, E-mail).
- versioning of changes in data about the entity - stored historical data, available for inspection by the PFSA Employee,
- verification of updated data by the UKNF Employee and after correct verification recording them in the Entity Database,
- scheduling, for alerts cyclically appearing during external user access sessions with confirmation of current data of the supervised entity.

## Functions of the Authentication and Authorization Module

The module is designed to enable:

➢ registration of external users via an online form,
➢ handling access requests with assigning permissions to external users,
➢ selection of the entity represented in the session by an authenticated external user.

### Description of the function

The registration of external users shall ensure:

- registration of external users via the online form, in particular:
- registration of external users (Administrators of the Supervised Entity, Employee of the Supervised Entity),
- creation of an account by an external user via an online form (mandatory fields: First name, Last name, PESEL [masked, last 4 digits visible], phone, e-mail),
- sending a link to activate the account to the user's e-mail address and setting the user's password to the system in accordance with the adopted policy of creating passwords in the system.

The handling of access requests shall ensure:

- handling access requests with granting/removing the right to individual system functions for the selected entity with the possibility of updating them and adding annexes, in particular:
- after the correct activation of the user account in the system (registration), automatic generation of the request for access with the status "Working",
- editing of the access request by the entity's representative, mandatory fields: First name, Last name, PESEL [masked, visible last 4 digits], phone number, e-mail downloaded from the form when registering the user,
- adding powers within a given Supervised Entity by selecting in the application, by the Internal User, from the list of entities (list of entities made available by the UKNF - Directory of Entities) supervised entities with which it will be associated and which will represent the so-called line of powers,
- assigning the permission requested by the user by marking the permission in checkboxes, e.g. permissions: Reporting, Cases, Entity Administrator,
- supplementing the e-mail address of the Supervised Entity, which will result in assigning the given e-mail address to the selected Entity and sending automatic e-mail notifications to this address, e.g. in the case of sending a report by the Employee of the Supervised Entity,
- after the access request has been validated by the external user, the message confirming the submission of the request and the change of the status of the request from 'Rollover' to 'New' is displayed,
- sending an automatic confirmation of submitting an access request to the e-mail address of the external user indicated during registration,
- acceptance of the application for access by an employee of the UKNF (for the Administrator of the Supervised Entity) or by the Administrator of the Supervised Entity (for the Employee of the Supervised Entity),
- after accepting the access request, display a message confirming the acceptance and change of the status of the request from "New" to "Accepted",
- possibility to mark statuses of applications. Application statuses:

| Status | Importance |
|---|---|
| Working | a request that has not yet been submitted for acceptance |
| New | an application that has been completed and submitted for approval |
| Accepted | request where all lines of allowances have been accepted |
| Blocked | request where all permission lines have been blocked |
| Updated | a proposal that has been modified and is awaiting re-acceptance |

- the ability of the UKNF Employee to communicate with an external user via electronic messages available at the level of the access request. For example, when verifying an access request in the event of an irregularity, the UKNF Employee may create and send a message to an external user asking for clarifications, with the possibility of adding attachments,
- the possibility of displaying in the form of a list of all applications registered in the system by the UKNF Employees and filtering them based on quick filters: 'My Entities' (applications of entities assigned to 'My Entities' with a UKNF Employee), 'Requires
- the possibility of displaying in the form of a list of registered applications of the Supervised Entity by the Administrator of this Supervised Entity,
- preview the history of the access request, the possibility to view the history of changes,
- preview by the UKNF Employee of the permission line of external users,
- blocking the rights of the Administrator of the Entity Supervised by UKNF Employees. Blocking the rights of the Entity Administrator will result in the Administrator losing access to the system. If the entity for which the Administrator has been blocked is assigned a second / different Administrator of the entity, it will be able to continue to accept and manage access requests of other users assigned to this entity. Blocking the Administrator of the Supervised Entity by the UKNF will not modify or block the rights of other users of the entity to whom the blocked Administrator accepted the rights. If for the entity in which the Administrator has been blocked, the second/other Administrators of the entity will not be accepted, then the modification and acceptance of the rights for the other users of the entity will require the acceptance of the UKNF,
- management by the Administrator of the Supervised Entity of the rights of the Employees of the Supervised Entity, including the possibility of modifying the rights of the Employees of the Supervised Entity in the scope, access to the Reporting modules (access / lack of access), Cases (access / lack of access), assigned Entities and access to the system (the possibility of blocking access to the system) only in the scope of the entity to which the Administrator of the Supervised Entity has rights.

### The selection of the entity represented in the session shall ensure:

- Selection, by an authenticated external user, of the entity represented in the session, i.e. in the selection of the entity to which the external user has assigned permissions,
- displaying on further navigation screens information in which context and role the user works.

## Functions of the Administrative Module

The module is designed to enable:

➢ **management of internal and external user accounts** by UKNF employees with the role of system administrator,
➢ **management of password policy in the** system,
➢ **managing the roles of internal and external users.**

### Description of the function

### The management of user accounts by UKNF Employees ensures:

- management of internal and external user accounts by UKNF employees with the role of System Administrator, in particular:
- adding/editing/deleting internal and external user accounts,
- setting passwords for internal and external user accounts.

### Management of password policy in the system ensures:

- managing passwords affecting their security, consistency and compliance with security requirements within the organisation, in particular:
- the ability to set the complexity of the password (length, uniqueness), the frequency of change and the length of the history (preventing the reuse of the last passwords),
- the ability to manually force a password change for selected users.

### Managing the roles of internal and external users ensures:

access management, where permissions are assigned to roles and roles are assigned to users, in particular:

- creating roles in the system,
- configuration of permissions for roles,
- assigning internal and external users to roles,
- View and update roles.
