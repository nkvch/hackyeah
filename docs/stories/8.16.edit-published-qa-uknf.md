## Dev Notes

### Live Updates

- Changes take effect immediately (no staging)
- Users see updated content on next page load or refresh
- Consider adding "Last updated" timestamp in public view

### Edit History

Track all edits for:
- Audit purposes
- Understanding Q&A evolution
- Rollback capability (future enhancement)

Store field-level changes:
- Which field changed (Title, Content, Answer, etc.)
- Previous value
- New value
- Who made the change
- When the change was made

### Significant Changes

Criteria for "significant change" (AC: 7):
- Answer completely rewritten (> 50% different)
- Answer meaning fundamentally changed
- Category changed
- Question meaning changed

Notification can be:
- Email to users who rated
- In-app notification
- Or skip for MVP (can be added later)

### User Experience (UKNF)

- Make editing easy with inline edit or dedicated edit page
- Pre-fill all current values
- Provide WYSIWYG editor for answer
- Show clear confirmation after save
- Display edit history for transparency

### User Experience (Public)

- Show "Last updated" date on Q&A (optional)
- Consider showing version number (future)
- Don't show who edited (internal info)
