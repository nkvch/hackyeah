## Story

**As a** UKNF Employee,  
**I want to** assign contacts and users to contact groups,  
**So that** I can use groups for targeted communications.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Employee can select Contact Group and add members:
   - External users (from system user list)
   - Contacts (from contacts list)
2. Employee can add multiple members at once (bulk add)
3. Employee can remove members from Contact Group
4. Employee can view all members of a Contact Group
5. Members list displays: Name, Email, Type (System User / Contact), Organization
6. Employee can search members within group
7. System prevents duplicate memberships (same person added twice)
8. System logs membership changes with timestamps

## Dev Notes

### Member Types

**SystemUser:**
- User with system account
- Can log in
- Receives in-app notifications + emails

**Contact:**
- Person without system account
- Cannot log in
- Receives emails only

### Duplicate Prevention

**Unique constraint:**
```sql
UNIQUE (ContactGroupId, MemberType, UserId, ContactId)
```

**Handler logic:**
```csharp
foreach (var userId in command.UserIds)
{
    // Check if already member
    var exists = await _repository.ExistsAsync(groupId, MemberType.SystemUser, userId);
    if (exists)
        continue; // Skip, don't throw error
    
    // Add member
    var member = new ContactGroupMember
    {
        ContactGroupId = groupId,
        MemberType = MemberType.SystemUser,
        UserId = userId,
        AddedBy = currentUserId,
        AddedDate = DateTime.UtcNow
    };
    await _repository.AddAsync(member);
}
```

Idempotent: Adding existing member is OK, just skip.

### Bulk Add

Allow adding multiple members at once for efficiency:
```json
POST /api/contact-groups/{id}/members
{
  "userIds": ["guid1", "guid2", "guid3"],
  "contactIds": ["guid4", "guid5"]
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "addedCount": 5,
  "skippedCount": 0,
  "message": "Added 5 members to group"
}
```

### Member Search

Search within group members by name or email:
```
GET /api/contact-groups/{id}/members?searchText=john&page=1&pageSize=50
```

### UI Design

**Contact Group Detail Page:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Contact Group: Quarterly Recipients │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Description: Recipients for Q reports│
│ Type: Report Recipients             │
│ Created: Oct 1, 2025 by John Doe    │
│                                     │
│ Members (15)       [Add Members]    │
│ [Search...] [Filter: All]           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─ Name ──────┬─ Email ──┬─ Type ─┐│
│ │ John Doe    │ j@...    │ User ● ││
│ │ Jane Smith  │ ja@...   │ Contact││
│ └─────────────┴──────────┴────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
