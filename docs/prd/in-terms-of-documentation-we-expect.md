# In terms of documentation, we expect:

preparing specifications for a standardised software development process using language AI models ensuring:

- documenting the used prompts in the prompts.md or prompts.pdf file provided with the repository (chronologically),
- an indication of which prompts were most effective and why,
- If part of the code was created manually and part generated by AI, describe what the division of labor looked like and where the prompts were most helpful.
