  overall_assessment: |
    Excellent recovery from initial FAIL gate. Development team addressed all critical
    issues comprehensively, adding 46 tests (exceeding minimum requirements), implementing
    rate limiting, and demonstrating commitment to quality. Password security implementation
    is now production-ready with proper validation, strong cryptography, and comprehensive
    test coverage. Minor performance concern (password history) is acceptable for current
    configuration and can be optimized if needed in the future.

commendation: |
  Outstanding work by the development team! The response to initial QA feedback was swift,
  comprehensive, and exceeded expectations. Test coverage went from 0% to 95%+, with
  high-quality tests that provide excellent regression protection. Rate limiting was
  properly implemented with appropriate configuration. This story demonstrates the team's
  commitment to security and quality standards. Well done! üéâ

next_steps:
  - 'Story owner can mark Story 1.3 as Done'
  - 'Consider adding E2E test in Story 1.4 (Login)'
  - 'Continue this quality standard for remaining authentication stories'
  
reviewer_notes: |
  This re-review took approximately 20 minutes. All test files were examined in detail,
  rate limiting configuration verified, and security controls validated. The development
  team's response to feedback was exemplary - all critical issues were resolved with
  high-quality implementations. This sets an excellent precedent for the project.
