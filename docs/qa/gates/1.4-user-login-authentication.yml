summary:
  review_outcome: PASS_WITH_CONCERNS
  confidence_level: HIGH
  key_strengths:
    - 'Comprehensive tests for login, token, and audit flows'
    - 'Secure JWT implementation with strict validation'
    - 'Rate limiting configured (5/15 min)'
  minor_concerns:
    - 'Missing 429 rate-limit test'
    - 'Audit logs missing IP/UserAgent data'
